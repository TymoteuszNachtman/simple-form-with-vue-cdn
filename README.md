# Simple form with Vue CDN

Simple, clean form with few data inputs. 

Validation logic is made by me. Form was built using Vue.js (from CDN) with Script Setup. Styled with Tailwind.css. There is mockup fetch function to visualize successfull form sending to backend.

Range radio inputs extended from codepen made by [Brandon McConell](https://codepen.io/brandonmcconnell), I think it's beautiful.

All data inputs are not being stored and are not send anywhere. :)
